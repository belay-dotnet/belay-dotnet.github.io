# Connection Troubleshooting

::: warning Documentation in Progress
This documentation is currently being developed based on common user issues and support requests.

**Status**: üìù Documentation in progress based on real-world testing  
**Expected completion**: After hardware validation phase
:::

## Coming Soon

This page will provide comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for connection issues, including:

- **Common Connection Errors**: Device not found, permission denied, timeout issues
- **Platform-Specific Solutions**: Windows, Linux, and macOS troubleshooting steps
- **Driver Issues**: USB-to-serial driver problems and solutions
- **Port Detection**: Finding and identifying correct serial ports
- **Permission Problems**: Linux/macOS permission and group membership issues
- **Hardware Debugging**: Physical connection and cable problems
- **Firmware Issues**: Corrupted firmware recovery procedures

## Common Issues Preview

### Device Not Found
```csharp
// Error: No devices discovered
var devices = await Device.DiscoverDevicesAsync();
if (devices.Length == 0)
{
    // Troubleshooting steps will be provided here
    Console.WriteLine("No MicroPython devices found");
}
```

### Connection Timeout
```csharp
try
{
    var device = Device.FromConnectionString("serial:COM3");
    await device.ConnectAsync(); // May timeout
}
catch (DeviceConnectionException ex)
{
    // Detailed timeout troubleshooting steps coming
    Console.WriteLine($"Connection failed: {ex.Message}");
}
```

### Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Common error on Linux
# SerialException: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'

# Solution will include adding user to dialout group
# sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

## Quick Diagnostic Tools

```csharp
// Example diagnostic utilities coming soon
public static class ConnectionDiagnostics
{
    public static async Task RunDiagnosticsAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("=== Belay.NET Connection Diagnostics ===");
        
        // Check available ports
        var ports = SerialPort.GetPortNames();
        Console.WriteLine($"Available serial ports: {string.Join(", ", ports)}");
        
        // Attempt device discovery
        var devices = await Device.DiscoverDevicesAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Discovered MicroPython devices: {devices.Length}");
        
        // Test each discovered device
        foreach (var device in devices)
        {
            await TestDeviceConnection(device);
        }
    }
    
    private static async Task TestDeviceConnection(DeviceInfo deviceInfo)
    {
        try
        {
            using var device = Device.FromConnectionString(deviceInfo.ConnectionString);
            await device.ConnectAsync();
            
            var response = await device.ExecuteAsync("print('Hello from device')");
            Console.WriteLine($"‚úÖ {deviceInfo.Port}: Connection successful");
            Console.WriteLine($"   Response: {response.Trim()}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"‚ùå {deviceInfo.Port}: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```
